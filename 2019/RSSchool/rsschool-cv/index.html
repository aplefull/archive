				<h1>Summary:</h1>
				<p>
					Started making my way into the IT-sphere at the age of 15.
                    At the time was interested in coding and design, so I'm familiar with corresponding types of software.
                    Now I'm studying and strive to improve my knowledge. I'm fast-learner and able to adapt to a new environment quickly.
                    That's why I'm always trying to find new ways of acquiring different skills. My current goal is to master web-development.
